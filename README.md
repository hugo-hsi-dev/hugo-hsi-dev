## Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

I'm Hugo Hsi, a full-stack web developer with a design background, passionate about crafting innovative and efficient web applications. Originally a design major, I discovered my love for coding through web development classes, and now I'm constantly exploring the tech landscape and building creative solutions.  

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on  
- **[Minecentral](https://github.com/Minecentral-Official/Minecentral-Dashboard)**: A suite of tools for Minecraft enthusiasts, including hosting services, plugin management, and server sharing.  
- A **decision-maker app** focused on group collaboration and choice management.  

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning  
- Nuxt, the fullstack framework built on Vue.  

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on  
- Projects that push the boundaries of modern web technologies, especially those using React, Next.js, or server-first design patterns.  

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about  
- React and its ecosystem (Next.js, TanStack Router, etc.).  
- Design principles and how they inform my development process.  
- Building intuitive user experiences with modern tooling.  

### ðŸ“« How to reach me  
- Portfolio: [hugohsi.dev](https://hugohsi.dev)  
- LinkedIn: [linkedin.com/in/hugo-hsi](https://linkedin.com/in/hugo-hsi)  

### âš¡ Fun fact  
Before diving into development, I actively avoided codingâ€”now I canâ€™t get enough of it. Whether itâ€™s experimenting with a new package or geeking out over the latest Next.js release, Iâ€™m always curious and eager to learn more.
